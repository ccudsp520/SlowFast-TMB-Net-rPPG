#### Abstract

This article presents a deep-learning-based two-stream network to estimate remote Photoplethysmogram (rPPG) signal and hence derive the heart rate (HR) from an RGB facial video. Our proposed network employs temporal modulation blocks (TMBs) to efficiently extract temporal dependencies and spatial attention blocks on a mean frame to learn spatial features. Our TMBs are composed of two subblocks that can simultaneously learn overall and channelwise spatiotemporal features, which are pivotal for the task. Data augmentation (DA) in training and multiple redundant estimations for noise removal in testing were also designed to make the training more effective and the inference more robust. Experimental results show that the proposed temporal shift-channelwise spatio-temporal network (TS-CST Net) has reached competitive and even superior performances among the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four popular datasets, showcasing our network’s learning capability.

## Installation
1. This project is developed using >= python 3.10 on Ubuntu 22.04.3! NVIDIA GPUs are needed. We recommend you to use an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) virtual environment.

```shell
  # 1. Create a conda virtual environment.
  conda create -n MS_rppg python=3.10 -y
  conda activate MS_rppg
  
  # 2. Install PyTorch >= v1.6.0 following [official instruction](https://pytorch.org/). Please adapt the cuda version to yours.
  pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117 torchvision==0.14.1+cu117 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
  
  # 3. Pull our code.
  git clone https://github.com/GuanHao-Fu/3stream_rppg.git
  cd MS_rppg
  
  # 4. Install other packages. This project doesn't have any special or difficult-to-install dependencies.
  pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Data preprocessing & build k-fold
2. Before training model, it is necessary to prepare the traing model which datatype it want. Executing **dataset_preprocess.py** transfer the video data to **h5py** data. After bulid h5py file, excuting **built_k_fold,py** generate k-fold trainging and testing dataset 
```shell
  # dataset_preprocess
  cd utils
  python dataset_preprocess.py --root_dir [original_DATASET_PATH] --save_dir [preprocessed_DATASET_PATH]

  # built_k_fold
  python built_k_fold.py --root_dir [preprocessed_DATASET_PATH] --save_dir [saved_ DATASET_PATH]
```
## Training 

```shell

  python train.py --dataset_dir [kfold_DATASET_PATH] --checkpoint_dir [CHECKPOINT_PATH]

```
## Inference 

```shell

  python test.py --dataset_dir [kfold_DATASET_PATH] --checkpoint_dir [CHECKPOINT_PATH]

```
The default video frame rate is **30Hz**. Please change the frame rate when you using the dataset recorded by other frame rate. 

## Note
If you want to change the input image size for training and testing, you needed to check **train.py** and **test.py** file import different package. We write two types code for image size =36 and 72.

if the input image size = **36**, uncomment following two lines code
```shell
  from models36 import is_model_support, get_model
  from dataset.dataset_loader36 import dataset_loader
```
if the input image size = **72**, uncomment following two lines code
```shell

  from models72 import is_model_support, get_model
  from dataset.dataset_loader72 import dataset_loader
```
